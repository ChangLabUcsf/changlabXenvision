This coding exercise was created by members of the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) for internship students with the [ENVISION](https://neurosurgery.ucsf.edu/envision-internship-program) Program at UCSF.

## 1. Using Google and Google Chrome
1. We'll need to use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for 
   this, so download and install that if you don't already have it.
2. We'll also need a Google account to use Google Drive, [create a free account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) if you don't have one already.

## 2. Downloading the code
1. If you're not already at this link, go [here](https://github.com/ChangLabUcsf/changlabXenvision) to download the code.
2. First, we'll download a `.zip` file containing all the code and 
   resources in this repository. Find the green button at the top left corner of this page that says 
   "Code" and select the "Download ZIP" option.

3. Unzip this folder (on a Mac, simply double click the zipped file; on 
   Windows, right click and select "Extract All" and follow the 
   instructions). You should now see the contents of the folder.
4. Upload this folder to your Google Drive (under the "My Drive" heading. Don't put it within any folders). We'll be using Google 
   Colab to interact with the code. More details on that below.

## 3. Setting up Google Colab
Google Colab is a great way to execute code without having to install 
Python yourself. Google Colab opens notebooks through your Google Drive, so 
you can save your progress as you make changes.

1. Install the Google [Colab extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=en) in Chrome.
2. Restart your Chrome browser by closing it and opening it again.

## 4. Testing that everything works!
1. In a Google Chrome browser, navigate to your Google Drive folder with the 
   notebook we'll be using (`AuditoryProcessing.ipynb`).
2. Double click on the file to open it--a tab should open with the Colab 
   interface.

3. Try executing the first code cell. You can do this by clicking on the cell 
   and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by clicking the "Play" button on the 
   left side of the cell. This cell will import one Python package and try 
   to set up your Google Drive so that we can load code and data 
   from our Google Drive folder.

4. It will ask you to open a link and log into your Google account, give 
   you a token, which you'll copy into the cell. If you have trouble at 
   this step, we'll walk through this at the beginning of the tutorial.
5. Otherwise, you're all set!
